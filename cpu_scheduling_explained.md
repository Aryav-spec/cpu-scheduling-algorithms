# CPU Scheduling Algorithms in Python

# ðŸ§  Why did I do this?
I created this project to learn how different CPU scheduling algorithms work under the hood. Scheduling is a huge part of how different operating systems manage processes, and I wanted to go beyond just the theory and actually implement these algorithms in Python.
