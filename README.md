# cpu-scheduling-algorithms
ðŸ’» A collection of CPU scheduling algorithms implemented in Python, including FCFS, Round Robin, SJF, SRTF, and Priority Scheduling â€” with a blog-style explanation of each.

This project simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms used in operating systems to manage multitasking. It includes clean Python implementations of:

- First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
- Round Robin (RR)
- Shortest Job First (SJF) â€“ Non-Preemptive
- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) â€“ Preemptive
- Priority Scheduling â€“ Preemptive and Non-Preemptive

> ðŸš§ Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ) implementation coming soon!
